# 📦 Components of the Internet

---

## 👤 Client
- **Definition** → A client is a **device or software** that requests services or resources from a server.  
- **Examples** → Computer, smartphone, or web browser when you access a website.  
- **Role** → Sends requests to the server and **displays the response** to the user.  

---

## 🖥️ Server
- **Definition** → A server is a **device or software** that provides services or resources to clients.  
- **Examples** → Web server (Apache, Nginx), Database server (MySQL), Email server.  
- **Role** → Receives requests from clients, **processes them**, and sends back responses.  

---

# 🔄 Interaction Process (Request-Response Cycle)
1. **Client sends a request** → e.g., data, file, or service.  
2. **Server receives & processes** the request.  
3. **Server sends response** back to the client.  
4. **Client displays** the response to the user.

# 📊 Types of Client-Server Models

### 🟢 Two-Tier Model
- **Structure** → Client (front-end) + Server (back-end).  
- **Example** → A simple web app where the browser interacts directly with the web server.  

### 🟡 Three-Tier Model
- **Structure** → Client + Application Server (middle-tier) + Database Server.  
- **Example** → Web app where client requests go through an **application server**, which then interacts with a **database server**.  

### 🔵 N-Tier Model
- **Structure** → Multiple layers between client and server, each with specific functions.  
- **Example** → Complex enterprise applications with **presentation, business logic, data access layers**.  

---

# 🌟 Benefits of Client-Server Architecture
- **Resource Sharing** → Multiple clients share server resources (data, processing power, storage).  
- **Scalability** → Easily add more servers or clients.  
- **Centralized Management** → Resources are maintained and managed on the server.  

---

# ⚠️ Challenges
- **Dependency** → If the server goes down, clients can’t access services.  
- **Security** → Requires strong protection against unauthorized access.  
- **Performance** → Server performance directly impacts the system’s performance.  

---

# 🌐 Real-Life Example
Imagine you’re using **Netflix**:  
- **Client** → Your smart TV or computer.  
- **Server** → Netflix’s servers storing & streaming videos.  
- **Process** → You (client) request a movie → server processes request → streams video back to you.

# 📌 Recap
- **Client** → Requests services.  
- **Server** → Provides services.  
- **Models** → Two-tier, Three-tier, N-tier.  
- **Benefits** → Resource sharing, scalability, centralized management.  
- **Challenges** → Dependency, security, performance.
